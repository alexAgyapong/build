# .NET Core 2.1 simple Dependency Injection micro framework

## Features

* Declarative metadata attribute driven initialization
* Lazy type resolution and initialization
* Circular references detection
* Singleton initialzation
* Automated and manual type registration
* Type aliases
* External assembly types

The goal of development of this framework is build automation of complex types.

Build can use declarative approach to define dependencies between types and their requirememts.

Constructor injection uses type resolution to resolve devendencies
